Github intro demo

Hello world! I am Steven from Pittsburgh, USA and I am restarting my journey to my first job in software development. I have a dual
BA in Economics
and Political Science and after taking a couple of CS classes in my last two semesters I really wanted to get into the nitty gritty 
of development. Post graduation in 2016 I have continued work in customer and client services, however now 2 1/2 years later I feel
it is time to find a real career doing challenging, interesting work. I am both terrified and excited to get going. I am now 96
days into a challenge I set for myself to code one hour per day and while aimless, I am getting ready to start a post-bachelors
certificate in Software Development.
